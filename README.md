# toolkit-archive

This is a collection of R scripts provided **as is** as a record of all of the tools we created during the course of working on 3EA's Lebanon and Niger projects. This repository will not be updated frequently. Much of the functionality found here will be extracted and polished into smaller, single-purpose packages like:

- blueprintr (not yet uploaded): automate and document all of your data transformations, powered by [`drake`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)
- [panelcleaner](https://github.com/Global-TIES-for-Children/panelcleaner): homogenize messy panel/longitudinal surveys easier
- [rcoder](https://github.com/Global-TIES-for-Children/rcoder): a simple data structure that captures categorical variables' metadata and lineage
